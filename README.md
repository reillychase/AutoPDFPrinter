# AutoPDFPrinter
Given an website URL with links to PDFs, this Python program downloads all PDFs and prints them without any user interaction.

- All PDFs are printed to the default printer
- Only works on Windows
- PDF downloads are deleted after being printed

AutoPDFPrinter was orginally written for an ecommerce store to be able to download and print all shipping labels automatically. 
 
I have simplified this program to make it useful for others to include in their own programs or use stand alone because I did not find any program like this.

If you need a custom integration of AutoPDFPrinter to authenticate with your own website before printing the PDFs, let me know.
